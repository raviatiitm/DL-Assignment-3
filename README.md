# DL_Assignment3

Q1
	-Here we have computed the total no of computations done by our network and total no.of parameters present in our network.It is present in WANDB report
  
Q2
	-This ipynb file is used to build a small model consisting of encoder and decoder layers for our model
	-To make the code flexible, we have make the parameter flexible.
	-cell,embedding_size,hidden_size,Number of encoder and decoder layers, dropout are the 5 inputs taken.
 	-please pass these 5 inputs to in train function to run the code.
	
Q3
	-Here we have written observation about the observation about the our sweep. what leads to more accuracy and all.
	It is also present in WANDB report
	
Q4
	-This ipynb file is used to build a small model consisting of encoder and decoder layers for our model
	-Here we are testing our model on test data.
	-Please pass the hyperparameters mentioned in report to get the best test accuracy.
	-cell,embedding_size,hidden_size,Number of encoder and decoder layers, dropout are the 5 inputs taken.
 	-please pass these 5 inputs to in train function to run the code.
	
Q5
	-This ipynb file is used to build a small model consisting of encoder and decoder layers with attention mechanism.
	-Here we are sweeping over train data to train our network using attention.
	-Then we are calculation the test accuracy and comparing with vanilla version.
	-Please pass the hyperparameters mentioned in report to get the best test accuracy.
	-cell,embedding_size,hidden_size,Number of encoder and decoder layers, dropout are the 5 inputs taken.
 	-please pass these 5 inputs to in attentiontrain function to run the code.
