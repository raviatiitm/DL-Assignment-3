Q1
	-This ipynb file is used to build a small model consisting of encoder and decoder layers for our model
	-To make the code flexible, we have make the parameter flexible.
	-cell,embedding_size,hidden_size,Number of encoder and decoder layers, dropout are the 5 inputs taken.
  -please pass these 5 inputs to in train function to run the code.
